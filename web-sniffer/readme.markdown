# web-sniffer

reimplementation of the graphical user interface of network night vision (which was running at some point on GTK and Windows) in JavaScript

This project requires:
 http (from https://github.com/dylan-lang/http)
 json (from https://github.com/dylan-lang/json)
 graph.js (from https://github.com/hannesm/graph.js)

set your ``OPEN_DYLAN_USER_REGISTRIES`` to include network-night-vision, http and json

put the graph stuff into ``static/graph``
